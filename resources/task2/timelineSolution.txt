Using the image above for reference, we show the path the bot will take and the time it takes.
We assume that all deliveries are correct in terms of the bot selecting the correct pizza, delivering it to the correct house, and delivering it within the deposition zone.
We also assume the following variables for certain actions. Different assumptions would change the maximum score achieved.
The variables are:
T = Time taken for robot to turn 90 degrees   = 1s
A = Time taken for robot to lower / raise arm = 1s
C = Time taken for robot to close / open grip = 0.5s

Our solution to the timeline is as follows:

Deliver Large Red pizza to H2
Step 1) r1->c6
    Time taken: 1s
Step 2) TACAT
    Time taken: 4.5s
Step 3) c6->r1
    Time taken: 1s
Step 4) r1->r2->r3->r4->h2
    Time taken: 15s + 1s = 16s
Step 5) TAC
    Time taken: 2.5s

Total time taken for operation = 25s
Cumulative tips received = 1 (for delivery in time)


Go back to pizza counter:
Step 1) AT
    Time taken: 2s
Step 2) h2->r1
    Time taken: 16s

Total time for operation = 18s
Cumulative time taken = 43s


Deliver Small Blue pizza to H5:
Step 1) r1->c8
    Time taken: 3s
Step 2) TACAT
    Time taken: 4.5s
Step 3) c8->r1
    Time taken: 3s
Step 4) r1->r2->r13->r12->r11->r10->r9->h5
    Time taken: 30s + 1s = 31s
Step 5) TAC
    Time taken: 2.5s

Total time taken for operation = 44s
Cumulative time taken = 87s
Cumulative tips received = 2


Go back to pizza counter:
Step 1) AT
    Time taken: 2s
Step 2) h5->r1
    Time taken: 31s
Total time taken for operation = 33s
Cumulative time taken = 120s


Deliver Small Green pizza to H10
Step 1) r1->c5
    Time taken: 1s
Step 2) TACAT
    Time taken: 4.5s
Step 3) c5->r1
    Time taken: 1s
Step 4) r1->r2->r14->h9->r15->h10
    Time taken: 25s
Step 5) TAC
    Time taken: 2.5s
Total time taken for operation = 34s
Cumulative time taken = 154s
Cumulative tips received = 3


Go back to pizza counter:
Step 1) AT
    Time taken: 2s
Step 2) h10->r1
    Time taken: 25s
Total time taken for operation = 27s
Cumulative time taken = 181s


Deliver Medium Red pizza to H8
Step 1) r1->c1
    Time taken: 5s
Step 2) TACAT
    Time taken: 4.5s
Step 3) c1->r1
    Time taken: 5s
Step 4) r1->r2-r13->h8
    Time taken: 11s
Step 5) TAC
    Time taken: 2.5s
Total time taken for operation = 28s
Cumulative time taken = 209s
Cumulative tips received = 4

Go back to pizza counter:
Step 1) AT
    Time taken: 2s
Step 2) h8->r1
    Time taken: 11s
Total time taken for operation = 13s
Cumulative time taken = 222s


Deliver Small Red and Large Green pizza to H7
Step 1) r1->c2
    Time taken: 4s
Step 2) TACAT (front arm)
    Time taken: 4.5s
Step 3) c2->c3
    Time taken: 1s
Step 4) TACAT (back arm)
    Time taken: 4.5s
Step 5) c3->r1
    Time taken: 3s
Step 6) r1->r2->r13->r12->h7
    Time taken: 15s + 1s = 16s
Step 7) TAC (simultaneous delivery)
    Time taken: 2.5s
Total time taken for operation = 35.5s
Cumulative time taken = 257.5
Cumulative tips received = 6 (for 2 pizza deliveries)


Go back to pizza counter:
Step 1) AT
    Time taken: 2s
Step 2) h7->r1
    Time taken: 16s
Total time taken for operation = 18s
Cumulative time taken = 275.5s


Deliver Large Blue pizza to H4
Step 1) r1->c7
    Time taken: 2s
Step 2) TACAT
    Time taken: 4.5s
Step 3) c7->r1
    Time taken: 2s
Step 4) r1->r2->r3->r4->r5->r6->r7->h4
    Time taken: 31s
Step 5) TAC
    Time taken: 2.5s
Total time taken for operation = 42s
Cumulative time taken = 317.5
Cumulative tips received = 6


Formula = (600 - T) + (CPD * 50) + (CPCD * 50) + (TIP * 50) + (CD * 10) - (IPD * 20) - (P*50)
According to our solution:
T = 317.5
CPD = 7
CPCD = 7
TIP = 6
CD = 7
IPD = 0
P = 0

Therefore:
Score = (600 - 317.5) + (7 * 50) + (7 * 50) + (6 * 50) + (7 * 10)
Score = 1352.5
