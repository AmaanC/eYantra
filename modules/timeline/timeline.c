// Here's how we plan on solving the order timeline
// First, you obviously have to enter the order timeline
// If the latest order is a regular order, we'll try to deliver it ASAP
// If our prediction function says we'll be late for the delivery, we'll consider dropping this delivery
// and moving on to the next one
// If there's time left to the next delivery (a.k.a. free time), we'll consider doing one of 3 things:
// 1) Find more Pizzas
// 2) Pick up preorder Pizzas
// 3) Pick up previously canceled / delayed orders 
// After every delivery is done, we want to consider using it as free time. If we can squeeze some
// extra work in, we might as well
// However, this could backfire in the sense that you *could* get away with taking some free time for the
// next 2 orders, but over time, it'll cost you because you'll be delayed for all orders after that
// Somewhere in the middle of all of this, we also need to consider instances when we will *definitely*
// need 2 arms, like when 1 house orders 2 Pizzas. In this situation, we don't want our second arm to be
// filled already.
// So the best thing to do might be to look for these *definite* needs first and "blocking off" that period
// of time. These blocked off periods will be considered in our "free time" considerations, and any overlapping
// permutations will be dismissed.

OrderList *our_timeline;

// State can be either 'f' or 'b' for free and busy
// When it's in the free state, it'll consider doing extra things in its free time like
// looking for more pizzas
// In its busy state, it'll find the next pizza due on the list, and just deliver that
char cur_state = 'f';

// we can check the future orders again for another "definite need"

    // that is due later.
