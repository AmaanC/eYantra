Reg:
    if we're in a blocked_time {
        predict time to find both pizzas
        predict time to deliver both
        if best prediction means we do it in time, do it // TODO: Best prediction or worst prediction?

        }

        }
    }

FindPizza:
    Go to r1
    Pick side we haven't visited before
    Detect pizza
    state = 'free'

Free:
    GetAvailablePizzas(TimeBlock) // gets all pizzas we've found that we can pick up in a certain period
    Eliminate pizzas which:
     - Overlap with blocked time
     - Delay our next scheduled order
     - Are already our next scheduled order

    If pizzas left on list, get one due earliest
    PickPizza(earliest_due_pizza)
    state = 'reg'

The only times the state changes are:
- Found new pizza (to free)
- Delivered pizza (to free)
- Picked up pizza (to reg)
- No time to do anything (to reg)

Hardware Control

- FindPizza // Figures out where pizzas are likelier to be found and goes there and calls DetectPizza
- PickPizza // Uses arm code to actually pick a pizza up in the correct arm
- DeliverPizza (cost of a + b vs. b + a) // delivers all pizzas in arms right now
- MoveBotToNode // Moves bot from A to B
- DetectPizza // Detects pizza based on color and size


Bot Memory

- Sensor location // So we don't have to hardcode its turns within the pizza counter
- Bot position // So all other modules can use it
- Arm location & status (whether carrying a pizza or not)
